 🌀 Dubosson-Feynman Engine (DFE)
Physics-Informed Symbolic Regression & Phase Transition Discovery



🚀 Overview
The Dubosson-Feynman Engine (DFE) is a breakthrough AI architecture designed for extracting fundamental physical laws from noisy or incomplete data. Unlike "black-box" neural networks, the DFE utilizes Membrane Regulation principles to identify phase transitions and threshold ruptures in dynamic systems.
💡 The Innovation: The "Dubosson Membrane"
At its core, the engine integrates sigmoidal primitives within the backpropagation process. This structure allows the engine to go beyond simple data correlation, effectively modeling the physics of thresholds (e.g., freezing/thawing, conduction/insulation, adhesion/friction).
📊 Final Performance Report (v2.0)
The development phase of the DFE v2.0 concluded on February 24, 2026. This version marks the transition from a theoretical prototype to a robust, physics-informed numerical architecture.

🛠 Technical Breakthroughs
Phase Transition Discovery: The engine successfully identified non-linear thresholds in biological (blood shear rate) and ecological (predation thresholds) systems.
Resilience & Shock Recovery: The v2.0 Shock Test proved that the engine can absorb sudden perturbations (e.g., 
 thermal shock) without losing the underlying physical law (
).
Mathematical Fidelity: The engine's ability to reconstruct the Riemann Prime Staircase using the first 13 non-trivial zeros demonstrates its power as a symbolic reconstructor.
🛠 Key Features
Instant Reactivity: Real-time recalibration during abrupt signal perturbations.
Out-of-Domain Extrapolation: Predicts asymptotic behavior even on unexplored data ranges.
Symbolic Extraction (Feynman Layer): Translates neural weights into readable mathematical equations (LaTeX/SymPy).
Spectral Riemann Analysis: Dedicated module for studying the zeros of the Zeta function and quantum chaos.
